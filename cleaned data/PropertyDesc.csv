WELCOME TO CAMERON STATION
Cameron Station is a community of single family homes, townhomes and condominiums located in the West End of Alexandria, Virginia. The award-winning designs were built according to the architectural styles of the 18th and 19th centuries and as a re-creation of an old-fashioned American small town. Brick sidewalks, colonial street lamps, pocket parks, and other unique environmental elements add to the community?s charm and unique ambiance.
The Cameron Club is a focal part of the community and includes a great room with kitchen for social and business gatherings, meeting rooms, a fitness center and gym, outdoor adult and children?s pools, and administrative offices. Retailers along Brenman Park Drive include a coffee house, restaurant, market, dry cleaners, spa and salon, dentist, and daycare facility. Alexandria?s newest grade school, Samuel W. Tucker Elementary, is located at the west end of the community, and Cameron Station is bordered by two city parks at each end?Ben Brenman Park and Armistead L. Boothe Park?both of which contain athletic fields and playgrounds. Also bordering the community are several dog parks, picnic areas, and bike paths. Alexandria?s central library, Charles E. Beatley Jr. Library, is directly across the street. A free shuttle bus transports residents to the nearby Van Dorn Metro station during morning and evening rush hours.
Upon entering, it is obvious that his two-story, 3 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath condominium exudes luxurious living. Every feature from the architectural half columns to the premium sound proof flooring to exquisite color selections has been specifically picked to enhance the floor plan but to also to accentuate the design of the community. The designer kitchen is a gourmet chefs dream with all stainless steal appliances (refrigerator, gas range, built-in microwave & dishwasher). In addition, the kitchen offers an island and tons of countertop & cabinet space. A double sided gas fireplace separates the living room and formal dining room. The 3 bedrooms are located on the second floor of the condo and the master bedroom with ensuite is truly a retreat with the vanity with double sinks, separate stand up shower and jetted tub.

789,"This classic mid-century Eastport cottage with water access to Back Creek has been stylishly remodeled to double the space, the sunlight, and the charm. Vintage pine floors glow amid period molding. The living room has been bumped out into a sun room large enough to warm a family's daily dinette; the old kitchen has had a hip rehab (think soapstone, not granite); the French doors of dining room (or maybe family room?) let out onto large yard framed by nativist landscaping. Original first floor bedroom is well sized, but needs an armoire; it has first floor full bath to itself.
Now up to the 2nd floor dormer addition: stairwell opens onto cozy sunlit nook; corridor leads to master loft, with his-'n-her closets; the master bedroom shares a full bath with kid bedroom (or office) through jack-'n-jill doors.
The Basement houses laundry and lots of storage space. Outdoors, expansive fenced-in yard includes stone patio for barbecue and lawn large enough for dog-runs, full-field T-ball, internecine volley ball, or competitive croquet.
Meander with the dog through Parkwood down to the community association's beach and piers on Back Creek. Or else head around the corner to the Eastport shopping mall -- to the Annapolis Gym for a work-out or rub-down; to Palate Pleasers for gourmet take-out &amp; baked goods; to the Eastport Farmer's Market for garden-fresh fruits &amp;amp; vegetables; to Eastport Kitchen for gourmet sadwiches; to Eastport Liquors for in-store specials on wines and liquors. Or hop over to Vin 909 across Bay Ridge for the popular wine-bar and small-plates, or saunter down Chesapeake Ave to Bakers &amp; Co. for buttery bread and pastries; then continue down to 6th St. and over the Annapolis harbor scene to City Dock.

1012,"1 Bedroom, 1 Bathroom Lease Takeover (not a sublease). Washer and dryer in unit. Happy to give anyone interested a tour of my place.
I am moving out of my apartment, and I need someone to take over the lease starting November 13 (date is flexible). Rent is $1,620 (additional $50 for unreserved garage parking if needed). Street parking is pretty easy to find, though, so up to you.
My apartment is very spacious, quiet, and the community is awesome (very dog friendly). It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the Ballston metro, so you're still within walking distance of everything Ballston has to offer, but also tucked away in a quieter part of town. It's very easy to get to Rte 50, I-66 & I-395, so also a great location for those who drive everywhere. 
The November rent will be prorated (depending on when you take over the lease). The current lease ends on December 6th, with the option to renew the current lease. The deadline to renew the current lease is November 14th. The pricing for the renewal lease depends on how long you are looking to stay; they give you the option of 1-15 months. (The 12 month rate is $1,700) I can put you in touch with the leasing office to help you with the renewal process.",0.0,0.0

The townhouse includes a furnished living room with a large flat-screen TV, fully-furnished dining room, kitchen with many appliances, an office/storage room, and fenced in backyard?all shared-use spaces (please see attached pictures). There are two parking spaces associated with the home, one of which would be for my new roommate. There are also ?visitor parking spaces? nearby for guests.
The spare bedroom is 12 ft x 9 ft; currently dark blue but ok if tenant paints to his or her liking. There is an average-sized closet attached. Bathroom for tenant across hallway; I won?t use it, and guests will only occasionally. (See attached)
Must be comfortable with dogs: 2 very playful dogs ? 5 year old Boston terrier and 2 year old mixed breed?located in the household. These dogs are super friendly once they get used to you, and very quickly start to consider roommates as part of their ""pack.""

This furnished corner unit has a galley kitchen with electric stove, garbage disposal, refrigerator, and dishwasher! There's air conditioning, a bathroom with the best water pressure in DC, and windows wrapping the walls the apartment - there's a window in every room! 
The living/dining room is large, and the bedroom easily fits a queen bed and dressers. Plenty of storage space in the walk-through closet. 
BUILDING: 
The President has a front desk staffed 24/7 that will sign for packages and watches the front door. There are 6 washers/dryers in the basement, and I've never had to wait to use them. The building is wired for Comcast and RCN. (You can look up reviews of The President, they're pretty accurate. In short, it's a pretty solid building in a great location - this place is a good value.) The building is mostly studio/efficiency units, but this is one of the biggest apartments in the building, a coveted corner 1-bedroom. 
LOCATION: 
The apartment is in a fantastic location, across the street from the Foggy Bottom Whole Foods Market. It's situated at the north end of George Washington University's campus, you're only steps away from the IMF, World Bank, State Department, and White House. Transportation is a breeze - The apartment is one block away from the Foggy Bottom metro station (blue and orange lines) & bus stops (including the Circulator), and there are two sets of Capital Bikeshare docks within half a block. You're only a 5-15 minute walk from Dupont, Georgetown, West End, and downtown DC.

If you have a car, the apartment does not include a spot, but it's Zone 2 parking, and you should be able to find a spot within 2 blocks of the apartment, especially after Whole Foods closes at 10pm. 
LEASE TERMS/FEES: 
The rent is $1,850/month, and includes water and trash. The tenant is responsible for electric and phone/cable/internet. Electric depends on use, but we have averaged $40-80 a month. 
There's an application fee of $50.00 per applicant, and you'll need to provide first month's rent + security deposit equal to one month's rent upon application approval and leasing signing.

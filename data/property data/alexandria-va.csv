Located near the juncture of Duke and South Columbus, the residence has its own off-street parking space and permitted on-street parking is available to residents from the city. But you don't need a car to live at or commute from this location. 
Hardwood floors throughout, master bed has walk-in closet and separate bath. Lots of closet space and sunlight at this residence - a well-proportioned layout for Old Town. Additional space in finished basement gives you a little bit more room to hobby, read, or hang out. Cozy, low-maintenance yard. Social, friendly neighbors make it a great place to live.
Minimum 1 yr. lease at posted rent.

WELCOME TO CAMERON STATION
Cameron Station is a community of single family homes, townhomes and condominiums located in the West End of Alexandria, Virginia. The award-winning designs were built according to the architectural styles of the 18th and 19th centuries and as a re-creation of an old-fashioned American small town. Brick sidewalks, colonial street lamps, pocket parks, and other unique environmental elements add to the community’s charm and unique ambiance.
The Cameron Club is a focal part of the community and includes a great room with kitchen for social and business gatherings, meeting rooms, a fitness center and gym, outdoor adult and children’s pools, and administrative offices. Retailers along Brenman Park Drive include a coffee house, restaurant, market, dry cleaners, spa and salon, dentist, and daycare facility. Alexandria’s newest grade school, Samuel W. Tucker Elementary, is located at the west end of the community, and Cameron Station is bordered by two city parks at each end—Ben Brenman Park and Armistead L. Boothe Park—both of which contain athletic fields and playgrounds. Also bordering the community are several dog parks, picnic areas, and bike paths. Alexandria’s central library, Charles E. Beatley Jr. Library, is directly across the street. A free shuttle bus transports residents to the nearby Van Dorn Metro station during morning and evening rush hours.
Upon entering, it is obvious that his two-story, 3 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath condominium exudes luxurious living. Every feature from the architectural half columns to the premium sound proof flooring to exquisite color selections has been specifically picked to enhance the floor plan but to also to accentuate the design of the community. The designer kitchen is a gourmet chefs dream with all stainless steal appliances (refrigerator, gas range, built-in microwave & dishwasher). In addition, the kitchen offers an island and tons of countertop & cabinet space. A double sided gas fireplace separates the living room and formal dining room. The 3 bedrooms are located on the second floor of the condo and the master bedroom with ensuite is truly a retreat with the vanity with double sinks, separate stand up shower and jetted tub. 
Do not miss this opportunity to experience the Cameron Station lifestyle! 
Pets are considered on a case-by-case basis 
Tenants responsible for gas and electric. Water, sewer and trash are covered in HOA fees.

It sat empty for over 20 years until we acquired it and fully renovated it in 2004. Originally built as an office building, we renovated it into a full mixed-use building with retail on the first floor, executive offices on the 2nd and 3rd floors and apartments on floors 4, 5 & 6. 815 King St was beautifully restored into an art deco building complete with its unattended concierge desk in the lobby and limestone floors. Two elevators service the building. The roof reveals a spectacular garden overlooking the entire city and Washington in the distance. Each apartment features hardwood floors, a fireplace, granite counter tops on wood cabinets, limestone floors and walls in the bathrooms, and a washer and dryer in each apartment."

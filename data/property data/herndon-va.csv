You can see the official posting for the complex here: https://www.apartments.com/ashton-at-dulles-corner-herndon-va/sg6s7q6/, the apartment is the Serendipity with 1147 sq/ft. 
This is not a private sublease, everything will go through the leasing office to protect both parties. 
The lease ends April 14th. 
I will reimburse the application ($50) and admin fee ($150) when we sign over the lease. 
The rent for this apartment is normally $1,715, however, I will give a signing perk of $1,200 when the lease is signed to offset the cost and make the rent $1,515. 
I have also paid a $250 security deposit that you will be free to keep at the end of the lease. You are responsible for any additional security deposit fee due to your credit or background check. 
I have already paid October's rent. You can move in as early as Oct 14th. 
It is a beautiful apartment, and I am sad to leave it but I must move for work. 
It is a one bedroom, one bath with a loft. Two story living room, gorgeous view, quiet top floor apartment.
I do not smoke, however the complex does allow people to smoke if they wish. The apartment is smoke free at the moment."

Inspired in part by the existing historic elements from the previous structure, The Foundrys lofted ceilings, concrete columns and floors, and dramatic floor to ceiling windows create a vintage living experience rooted in texture and space unlike any found in the neighborhood. * THE FORGE * In juxtaposition to its sister building, The Forge is a brand new 6-story structure with 139 residences, featuring a wholly modern feel. With engineered wood floors and industrial fixtures and finishes, The Forge brings a modern sensibility to Brookland Press. The buildings exterior speaks to the former industrial uses across the site by incorporating brick with accents of stone and metal panels, while offering a warmer palette of textures and colors throughout."

Situated at the epicenter of Capitol Hill, 700 Constitution enjoys close proximity to everything you want to enjoy in this exciting area of DC. Enjoy a short stroll to Eastern Market to partake in the festivities. Head a little further south to Barracks Row and the hardest choice you’ll make is deciding which fabulous restaurant to dine at.

There is also a metrobus stop adjacent to the building. Relax after a long day in your own oasis. Let our concierge hand your finished dry cleaning as you pass through the uncompromised beauty of the lobby and terrace common areas into the serenity of your home complete with full height and in some cases Palladian sound proof windows, elegant and light granite surfaces, modern floor finishes, nine-inch crown moldings and so much more. Make your way to the rooftop terrace with fabulous views of the capitol to relax, grill dinner or enjoy a game of corn hole with your friends.

The Clarence House offers basic community amenities including a rooftop terrace and laundry room with WiFi, but people who choose the Clarence House tend to prefer that their rent go toward their actual apartments rather than toward community amenities they'll rarely use.

THE APARTMENT: Approx. 740 sq. ft. top-floor unit with skylight and bay windows. Amenities include fridge w/auto-icemaker, electric 5-burner range, over-the-range microwave/hood, dishwasher, garbage disposal, light dimmers/spots, charcoal gray w/w carpeting, central heat/AC, in-unit washer/dryer, whirlpool bathtub, and walk-in closet in the bedroom. The unit is cable-ready. Rent includes water. Tenant pays for electricity plus any services such as phone, cable TV, and Internet. For a small fee (if room is available) there is bicycle storage in the basement. Pets may be considered on an individual basis.
THE BUILDING/NEIGHBORHOOD: The Nelson Condo is in the heart of the vibrant Dupont Circle neighborhood. The Nelson is a fantastic and friendly community where the residents take pride in their city residence. The building is in the best location in city on the same block as the historic Frasier Mansion (now the Church of Scientology). From the front door, it is exactly a 2-block walk south to the Dupont Circle Metrorail station (Q St. entrance). This historic building underwent a first-class total renovation in the 1980's and has been immaculately and proactively maintained ever since. The building has 5 floors including basement and has a large elevator. An exceptionally competent and responsive management company manages the unit and the building. Parking is on-street and requires a city Zone 2 residential parking sticker (easy to get) if you don't want to move your car every day.
Grocery store, shops, restaurants, galleries, museums, bars and just about everything that city-living can provide are only feet away from your front door. The address is 1733 20th Street, NW DC 20009. Google it yourself to see what an outstanding location it is! It is an easy walk to GW University, the World Bank/IMF, and many downtown business locations. 
LEASE/FEES: The rent is $2,300/month and a year’s lease is required (may negotiate a shorter lease). There is a $35 application fee to cover the background and credit check. Once approved, the first month's rent plus a one-month security deposit must be presented with the signed lease. Move-in/out fees are required. 
Serious inquires only -- no 3rd parties - please e-mail to ask questions and set up a viewing.
Thank you.

LOCATED IN THE ADAMS MORGAN NEIGHBORHOOD OF WASHINGTON, D.C., YOU’LL WALK TO METRO AND EVERYTHING ELSE FROM THIS CONVENIENTLY LOCATED 2BR/1BA APARTMENT. 
Please note: Maximum occupancy for this space is two people. Additionally, utilities (electric only-no gas) for this apartment is the responsibility of tenant(s)–Aside from rent and electric usage, there are no other expenses–Water, Trash Service, Direct TV and High-Speed Internet are all inclusive in rent.
Unlike most street level apartments where natural light is an issue, this apartment has windows in every room. The building faces south giving access to ample sunlight throughout the day. Entering the apartment from street level, you’ll find a very spacious and open floor plan combining the living area and kitchen. The living area has all hardwood flooring and joins a nicely configured kitchen which includes a GE refrigerator with ice maker, dishwasher, and a new ceramic top electric range. Granite counter tops were recently added along with a deep stainless steel sink with a commercial grade faucet wand and garbage disposal. The counter space that opens to the living area can easily accommodate bar stools and is perfectly suited for entertaining and/or the convenience of passing prepared foods.
Connecting the living area to the bedrooms and bathroom is a hallway covered in beautiful ceramic tiles. Extending from the hallway you will find a utility room with a stacked washer/dryer and shelving for extra storage. The bedrooms are quite spacious (see a link to floor plan below) with large closets. Both bedrooms have newly installed ceramic tile and under the tiles is electric radiant floor heating–you’ll love this amenity during the winter months and each bedroom has its own thermostat to independently control your personal level of comfort. The bathroom is centrally located with two doors connecting both the master bedroom and a common entry from the hallway. The shower was recently renovated with glass tiles in the shower surround accented with translucent glass tiles.
There is a new energy efficient heat pump (central air unit) with a programmable/digital thermostat that provides heating and cooling comfort year-round. Electric usage is the responsibility of tenant(s) and you must secure an electric account with PEPCO (D.C.’s electric cooperative) upon execution of lease. This apartment also has access from the master bedroom to a nicely landscaped garden/patio area with table and chairs and a BBQ grill.

High up on the quiet side of the building, all of the unit's large windows look out over the treetops of Glover Archbold park. The apartment has a tranquil, lofty feel and you can easily escape to a wooded retreat, accessing the Glover Archbold hiking trail right next to the building - but city living conveniences are close at hand.
A bus stop directly in front of the building allows for a super easy commute downtown on the Mass Ave line (N2/4/6 to Dupont, Farragut North), while the northbound buses connect quickly to the Tenleytown and Friendship Heights Metro stations.
Closer to home, you'll find a short stroll up New Mexico Ave gets you to a Starbucks and shopping at Foxhall Square. You can enjoy Chef Geoff's excellent happy hour or delectable take out from Wagshal's without ever getting in the car. 
If you drive, though, you'll be happy to know that a convenient, dedicated parking space is included in the monthly rent for this apartment. While it is not in an enclosed garage, it is just steps away from the buildings rear entrance.
4200 Cathedral Avenue's greatest amenity is certainly its location. But there is more to love with a striking mid century modern decorated lounge/reception and helpful, considerate 24-hour concierge service. Other common spaces include a well appointed and meticulously well-kept laundry room and a private rooftop deck.
From the common hall, the apartment opens to a small entry area with a well-sized coat closet. Immediately to the left is a large linen closet, and continuing in that direction you will find the bathroom and the entryways to the two bedrooms. The master bedroom has a walk-in closet with built-in shelves. The smaller bedroom also has a closet. To the right of the apartment's main door you look into a large, open L-shaped room that encloses the kitchen. When we lived in the apartment, we used zones of the space for dining, an office, and a living room. Some of our tenants have even carved out an additional bedroom from the space; you can easily adapt it for your needs.
The kitchen has full-sized appliances and pull-out storage. The bedrooms and main living area each have their own programmable thermostat.
The apartment has been cleaned to the nines and is freshly repainted, ready for you to move in and make it your own.
Please be in touch; we'd love to show you the place soon!"

I am leaving sometime between October 6-10th so I am flexible with the move in date.
Great location for all types of activities. Dupont circle, U street and Adams Morgan are all within walking distance of this apartment. That being said, there are a myriad of places to eat, have a drink or go for a workout. 
You will be sharing the basement with another male roommate, so this space is only for males. The living room is the first room when you walk in, along with the kitchen (see the attached photos). Your room is the first room closest to the front door.
The room is 8 x 10 feet space with a built-in closet. There is enough space for a dresser, and a full bed. A small desk could also fit. 
The room is available for $1345 per month. Utilities are not included, but they are typically around $100 a month. Washer and Dryer are available in the apartment
I'm sad to leave such an amazing place but I hope to find a great replacement."

This furnished corner unit has a galley kitchen with electric stove, garbage disposal, refrigerator, and dishwasher! There's air conditioning, a bathroom with the best water pressure in DC, and windows wrapping the walls the apartment - there's a window in every room! 
The living/dining room is large, and the bedroom easily fits a queen bed and dressers. Plenty of storage space in the walk-through closet. 
BUILDING: 
The President has a front desk staffed 24/7 that will sign for packages and watches the front door. There are 6 washers/dryers in the basement, and I've never had to wait to use them. The building is wired for Comcast and RCN. (You can look up reviews of The President, they're pretty accurate. In short, it's a pretty solid building in a great location - this place is a good value.) The building is mostly studio/efficiency units, but this is one of the biggest apartments in the building, a coveted corner 1-bedroom. 
LOCATION: 
The apartment is in a fantastic location, across the street from the Foggy Bottom Whole Foods Market. It's situated at the north end of George Washington University's campus, you're only steps away from the IMF, World Bank, State Department, and White House. Transportation is a breeze - The apartment is one block away from the Foggy Bottom metro station (blue and orange lines) & bus stops (including the Circulator), and there are two sets of Capital Bikeshare docks within half a block. You're only a 5-15 minute walk from Dupont, Georgetown, West End, and downtown DC. 
PARKING: 
If you have a car, the apartment does not include a spot, but it's Zone 2 parking, and you should be able to find a spot within 2 blocks of the apartment, especially after Whole Foods closes at 10pm. 
LEASE TERMS/FEES: 
The rent is $1,850/month, and includes water and trash. The tenant is responsible for electric and phone/cable/internet. Electric depends on use, but we have averaged $40-80 a month. 
There's an application fee of $50.00 per applicant, and you'll need to provide first month's rent + security deposit equal to one month's rent upon application approval and leasing signing. 
Property Management: 
The rental is professionally managed by EJC Property Management, LLC . We can be contacted at 866-765-9981, ext. 1012, Monday through Friday, from 9am to 5pm. BY APPOINTMENT ONLY.

Renovations were recently completed on this spacious and ideally located English Basement. The unit features a massive living room, a spacious kitchen – outfitted with the latest kitchen appliances (double electric oven range, top of the line dishwasher, microwave and refrigerator), a sizable bedroom, and beautiful bathroom. The unit also includes its own washer/dryer unit and is accompanied by a large gorgeous private patio – which includes amazing bistro string lights, a gas and electric grill. This is a terrific location: Steps from the extremely popular 14th Street (but just far enough away to avoid the noise), an easy walk to DuPont, Adams Morgan, Columbia Heights and close to Trader Joe’s, gyms, (Vida Fitness, Washington Sports Club, CrossFit, and a local YMCA) yoga classes (i.e. YogaWorks and Yoga District), Soul Cycle, amazing coffee shops (The Wydon Coffee Bar and Peregrine Espresso), and great restaurants (way too many to list). The house has a walk score of 99, and is WALKING DISTANCE to downtown DC jobs, and there are numerous bus lines (54, 52, S1, S2, S4, S9) to downtown (if you don’t want to walk). Also close to the Yellow and Green metro lines (and a reasonable walk from Red). The unit also literally steps out to a bike path, thus if you are a biker, this is an additional plus."

The vibrant community along H Street is developing into an arts and entertainment district. The revival of this neighborhood was kicked-off with the opening of the Atlas Performing Arts Center, an art-deco 1930s movie theater that was converted into an arts complex with multiple theaters and dance spaces.

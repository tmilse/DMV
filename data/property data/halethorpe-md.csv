With its open floor plan and retro wood moldings in each of the three bedrooms, it has a charm that will never go out of style. One special feature that stands out the most in this home is a pink and black bathroom, a hallmark trend of the 1950~s that was started by First Lady Mamie Eisenhower~s love of pink. A must see.

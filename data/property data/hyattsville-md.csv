Two bedroom apartment, one bath, about 900 sf, very sunny. Central heating and AC. Fourth floor in an elevator building.
The kitchen has stove, fridge, microwave, dishwasher and your own combo washing machine/dryer. There are also laundry facilities downstairs. 
The floor is wood laminated and there are several closets around the house, including one walking closet (bigger than in the map). The living room has a balcony (good size).
There is a gym in the next building open all year around for residents.
Parking lot is assigned but there are also many parking spots for visitors/residents. 
The management company works really well and they take care of everything in the community.
We love our place. It is very charming and really quiet!!!
It is also very well located, close to DC and very close to the metro (Fort Totten station, by walking or by bus) what is also very convenient. The supermarket is around the corner. University of Maryland, Catholic University of America, Howard University and other colleges are very close too.
Perfect place for professionals. 
Electricity is included in the price (AC included)."

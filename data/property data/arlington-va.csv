Our awesome 3BR 1.5ba group house is losing two members, and I'm looking to fill their slots for a Dec 1st move-in. The house is in Lyon Park, one mile away from Clarendon Metro. One room is on the ground floor and has an attached half bath, the other is on the second level. Both will easily accommodate a Queen size bed, along with a desk, bookshelf, etc. The house will be mostly unfurnished since the departing guys are taking all their stuff. I'm in the process of acquiring replacements, but preference will be given to anyone who has a dining table, chairs, TV stand, etc. 
I'm a 30-something working professional who loves to cook, amateur wine geek, and I enjoy working out during the week, but on weekends I enjoy hanging out or going on day trip, kickball, and occasionally driving out to a Loudoun County brewery/winery. I enjoy being friendly with housemates, whether that be catching a happy hour, going to a show, or having a house dinner, but I also understand everyone needs time to themselves. 
Rent is $900/month (per room.) Utilities (heat/electricity/Cable/Wi-Fi) are about $150, depending on the season. Water is paid quarterly and is about $100/pp. Also, to prevent anyone from feeling like they are always the one replacing the TP, paper towels, dish soap, etc., we share those expenses. -	Washer/dryer in basement

Washer and dryer in unit. Happy to give anyone interested a tour of my place.
I am moving out of my apartment, and I need someone to take over the lease starting November 13 (date is flexible). Rent is $1,620 (additional $50 for unreserved garage parking if needed). Street parking is pretty easy to find, though, so up to you.
My apartment is very spacious, quiet, and the community is awesome (very dog friendly). It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the Ballston metro, so you're still within walking distance of everything Ballston has to offer, but also tucked away in a quieter part of town. It's very easy to get to Rte 50, I-66 & I-395, so also a great location for those who drive everywhere. 
The November rent will be prorated (depending on when you take over the lease). The current lease ends on December 6th, with the option to renew the current lease. The deadline to renew the current lease is November 14th. The pricing for the renewal lease depends on how long you are looking to stay; they give you the option of 1-15 months. (The 12 month rate is $1,700) I can put you in touch with the leasing office to help you with the renewal process."

Negotiable lease terms, open to 6 mos or more. 
Open house Saturday, Sept. 23, 10:30-12:30. 
Kitchen has granite countertops and high wooden cabinets, tons of storage! Also, a rarity in Arlington units, this one offers a full dishwasher. Kitchen window looks out on large porch in private area. You see only trees! Ideal spot for morning coffee and reading a book or the newspaper. Kitchen has hardwood floors. Living room is spacious, with large window. Also attached is huge storage closet which easily holds numerous coats, (big bulky ones too), golf clubs, vacuum cleaner and tons of boxes (we know, we have filled it to capacity and then some). Wood burning fireplace to keep you warm in the winter and ceiling fan which helps keep you cool in summer if you don't want to use AC. Berber carpet throughout living room and other rooms in the house. Two bedrooms. Both have ceiling fans. First bedroom is large with HUGE walk-in closet, as well as linen closet. Window is partially covered by tree so helps provide shade so you can sleep, or have windows open and hear some of the birds in the area. Second bedroom is smaller, but easily fits a bed and other items. Decent size closet. Washer and Dryer in unit are practically new, just installed in 2014. Express Bus to Pentagon stops steps away from your door. To give you an idea, I would leave at 8:49 to catch 8:50 bus and be at my desk drinking coffee in Metro Center by 9:30, sometimes earlier! Rent includes two parking spots. Downtown Shirlington is a thriving area with restaurants, theaters and a Harris Teeter. It is a 12 minute walk. There are numerous trails in the area for walking and running, as well as tons of playgrounds near by. One of the largest dog parks in the area is a 10 minute walk down Walter Reed. We are less than 3 miles from the Mark Center and almost immediately off of 395. Military discount available. Available for viewing upon request. Thanks for interest! Look forward to hearing from you."

Features: Pentagon and Pentagon City metro stops (blue & yellow lines) are 1.5 mile away, Ballston metro (orange line) is 2 miles. A bus running up George Mason will take you to Ballston metro in eight minutes. The restaurants on Columbia Pike are excellent, esp. Bangkok 54. Barcroft Recreation center on Four Mile Run is less than a mile and has excellent fitness classes for all ages, as well as a gym. At Penrose Square (less than one mile) are a brand new Giant and an excellent yoga studio. W&OD bike trail is just under one mile. Across the street at Westmont Gardens apartment complex is a pool you can join for the summer for a fraction of the usual cost of a pool membership in NoVa; excellent pool for children, not crowded. Bus stops on Columbia Pike serve Arlington's busiest bus line, down Columbia Pike to both Pentagon metro and Pentagon City. Excellent service during rush hour.

Vintage pine floors glow amid period molding. The living room has been bumped out into a sun room large enough to warm a family's daily dinette; the old kitchen has had a hip rehab (think soapstone, not granite); the French doors of dining room (or maybe family room?) let out onto large yard framed by nativist landscaping. Original first floor bedroom is well sized, but needs an armoire; it has first floor full bath to itself.
Now up to the 2nd floor dormer addition: stairwell opens onto cozy sunlit nook; corridor leads to master loft, with his-'n-her closets; the master bedroom shares a full bath with kid bedroom (or office) through jack-'n-jill doors.
The Basement houses laundry and lots of storage space. Outdoors, expansive fenced-in yard includes stone patio for barbecue and lawn large enough for dog-runs, full-field T-ball, internecine volley ball, or competitive croquet.
Meander with the dog through Parkwood down to the community association's beach and piers on Back Creek. Or else head around the corner to the Eastport shopping mall -- to the Annapolis Gym for a work-out or rub-down; to Palate Pleasers for gourmet take-out &amp; baked goods; to the Eastport Farmer's Market for garden-fresh fruits &amp;amp; vegetables; to Eastport Kitchen for gourmet sadwiches; to Eastport Liquors for in-store specials on wines and liquors. Or hop over to Vin 909 across Bay Ridge for the popular wine-bar and small-plates, or saunter down Chesapeake Ave to Bakers &amp; Co. for buttery bread and pastries; then continue down to 6th St. and over the Annapolis harbor scene to City Dock. Nice way to live.
For an appointment to view, call Jason or Liz at 443-699-5438. Minimum lease is 6 months. Available October 1st. $2700.00/mo, $2700.00 security deposit. This property is managed by a responsible landlord using Rentalutions landlord software."

REVIEWS
""This is one of the finest places I have stayed at. It's spacious, uniquely styled and decorated, clean and in a quiet neighbourhood. It's located a short cab drive away from Dulles airport and from here you walk to downtown Reston. The communication with Shazia was great. She assisted me with what I needed and replied quick all the time. Highly recommended. - Johan M.
""Shazia was incredibly kind and welcoming and her home was so inviting and cozy. I couldn't have been happier and would highly recommend!"" - Sarah J.
""Shazia was amazing start to finish. She was communicative from the get-go, offering all kinds of helpful information and responding to questions almost immediately. Her home was incredibly easy to find, and as a bonus has its own garage. The inside of her home was... incredible. What a gorgeous residence! I got perhaps the best night's sleep I've had in years in that bed!! The location was super close to Washington-Dulles Airport and it's in a beautiful new neighborhood. If you have the chance to live here - do it!!"" - Bailey M.

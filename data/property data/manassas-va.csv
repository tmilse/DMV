I am a 30 year old High School teacher looking for a non-smoking, responsible roommate (male or female) in their 20s/30s (though other ages will be considered) for spare bedroom in my townhouse. Rent is $650 a month, though I will entertain other offers. This does not include utilities (gas, electricity, internet, etc.) but I am willing to negotiate a flat-fee that includes all of those things if you'd find that preferable. You can either request your initial deposit back at the end of your lease, or you can contribute it to first month's rent.
The townhouse includes a furnished living room with a large flat-screen TV, fully-furnished dining room, kitchen with many appliances, an office/storage room, and fenced in backyard—all shared-use spaces (please see attached pictures). There are two parking spaces associated with the home, one of which would be for my new roommate. There are also “visitor parking spaces” nearby for guests.
The spare bedroom is 12 ft x 9 ft; currently dark blue but ok if tenant paints to his or her liking. There is an average-sized closet attached. Bathroom for tenant across hallway; I won’t use it, and guests will only occasionally. (See attached)
Must be comfortable with dogs: 2 very playful dogs – 5 year old Boston terrier and 2 year old mixed breed—located in the household. These dogs are super friendly once they get used to you, and very quickly start to consider roommates as part of their ""pack."" 
The Townhouse is located in a convenient area -- 5 minute drive to 66 as well as minutes to local shopping areas (Giant, Starbucks, Best Buy, Barnes and Noble, Petsmart, Manassas Mall, etc.). 25 minutes to closest metro (Vienna).
Please email (danielkgeroe@gmail.com) or call (757-373-5969) with any questions or interest in viewing the house and the available room."

The Community: 2016s Money Magazine named Columbia the best small city to live in! Consistently named as one of the top cities to live in, Columbia is packed with trees, trails, rivers and lakes spanning several miles. Just steps from your front door, is the quiet and scenic Lake Elkhorn Trail! Following this trail (steps from the front door) in just a miles run or a quiet walk you will reach the scenic Lake Elkhorn Park shown in the photos below. Directly across the street, you have the East Columbia Public Library that has ample amount of well-lit study spaces, vast catalog of books and many more resources. Currently only partially opened, the library will reopen bigger and better this December with the finalization of its remodeling. There is a local Farmer's Market every Thursday in the parking lot of the library across the street! Giant Supermarket is also walking distance or 2-3 min driving. Columbia Mall, Whole Foods and the famous Merriweather Post Pavilion Amphitheater are less than 2mi away, situated near Lake Kittamaqundi. Lots of music, food, and shopping right by the water! Snowden Shopping Center less than 3 min drive. 20 min away from DC and Baltimore, both, off of RT29 and RT95.
Dasher Brown Community Center is a quarter of a mile away, where there is a fitness center, pool, and many more community resources!"

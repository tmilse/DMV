We offer adults, age 62 and over, beautiful, one and two bedroom apartment homes featuring energy-star appliances, dishwashers, disposals, microwaves, high-speed internet access, and washer/dryer hook-ups. Health conscious residents can take brisk daily walks around the walking path that surrounds the community or workout with the state-of-the-art equipment in the fitness center. For the technically-inclined, you can grab an iPad in the cyber café, a cup of coffee, and spend an hour or two surfing the web. Do you have a “green thumb”? Then you might want to grow your own vegetables or flowers in the greenhouse. Movie buffs can enjoy the on-site movie theater that comes with an old-fashioned popcorn machine; or you might gather a few friends to shoot some pool in the billiards room; or relax in the 50s-themed clubroom, which features an authentic diner-style lunch counter. Residents can read a good book while rocking on the front porch or enjoy an evening picnic on the outdoor teak furniture. In addition, the dayroom is the perfect place for yoga and meditating. To make sure you’re ready for your special evening, Hammarlee House comes equipped with a full service beauty salon."

With six (6) bedrooms and four (4) bathrooms, this forested home in an exclusive neighborhood gives you the privacy and wooded views that the Lakeview at Brandywine is known for. The massive three (3) car garage and extended driveway allow for ample parking for the whole family. This beautiful, privacy-fenced home was built in late 2012 with all the high-end features - ceramic tile, real hardwood floors, granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, and a large kitchen with dual oven. The master retreat and full en suite bathroom span an entire wing of the upstairs. 
Complimenting the basic luxury amenities is a 2nd master and full bathroom in the basement (with separate entrance) - perfect for an aging parent, adult child, or visiting relative - offering complete privacy and including a separate kitchenette with fridge. If that's not your style, enjoy a large downstairs movie room to watch the Sunday game or latest family flick! 
The community is very quiet and does not get a lot of through-traffic. It's 37 minutes from the garage to the US Capitol. The previous resident is the original owner, so we know that people who live in this neighborhood like to stay for long periods of time and enjoy living in the community."
